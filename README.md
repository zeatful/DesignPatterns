# Design Patterns - with Java examples
A design pattern is a repeatable solution to a common problem.  They are great to leverage to make code cleaner, more maintainable, more extensible and generally avoid design pitfalls for problems that easily fit into a given pattern.  Design patterns are no supplement for thoughtful design, but can prevent reinventing the wheel for a common problem.

## Purpose of this project
This project is my attempt to better my knowledge of design patterns through Java examples so that I can better recognize and socialize design patterns within my own development group.

## Design patterns can be categorized into three types:
* Creational
* Structural
* Behavioral

### Creational
* Abstract Factory
    - Creates an instance of several families of classes
* Builder
    - Separates object construction from its representation
* Factory Method
    - Creates an instance of several derived classes
* Object Pool
    - Avoid expensive acquisition and release of resources by recycling objects that are no longer in use
* Prototype
    - A fully initialized instance to be copied or cloned
* Singleton
    - A class of which only a single instance can exist
    
### Structural
* Adapter
    - Match interfaces of different classes
* Bridge
    - Separates an objectâ€™s interface from its implementation
* Composite
    - A tree structure of simple and composite objects
* Decorator
    - Add responsibilities to objects dynamically
* Facade
    - A single class that represents an entire subsystem
* Flyweight
    - A fine-grained instance used for efficient sharing
* Private Class Data
    - Restricts accessor/mutator access
* Proxy
    - An object representing another object
### Behavioral
